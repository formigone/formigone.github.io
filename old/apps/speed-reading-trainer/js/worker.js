   var secretGarden1 = "When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen It was true too She had a little thin face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour expression Her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people She had not wanted a little girl at all and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible So when she was a sickly fretful ugly little baby she was kept out of the way and when she became a sickly fretful toddling thing she was kept out of the way also She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all One frightfully hot morning when she was about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah Why did you come she said to the strange woman I will not let you stay Send my Ayah to me The woman looked frightened but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib There was something mysterious in the air that morning Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come She was actually left alone as the morning went on and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda She pretended that she was making a flower-bed and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned Pig Pig Daughter of Pigs she said because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England The child stared at him but she stared most at her mother She always did this when she had a chance to see her because the Mem Sahib Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else was such a tall slim pretty person and wore such lovely clothes Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things and she had large laughing eyes All her clothes were thin and floating and Mary said they were full of lace They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning but her eyes were not laughing at all They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officers face Is it so very bad Oh is it Mary heard her say Awfully the young man answered in a trembling voice Awfully Mrs Lennox You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago The Mem Sahib wrung her hands Oh I know I ought she cried I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party What a fool I was At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants quarters that she clutched the young mans arm and Mary stood shivering from head to foot The wailing grew wilder and wilder What is it What is it Mrs Lennox gasped Some one has died answered the boy officer You did not say it had broken out among your servants I did not know the Mem Sahib cried Come with me Come with me and she turned and ran into the house After that appalling things happened and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies The Ayah had been taken ill in the night and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror There was panic on every side and dying people in all the bungalows During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone Nobody thought of her nobody wanted her and strange things happened of which she knew nothing Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason The child ate some fruit and biscuits and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled It was sweet and she did not know how strong it was Very soon it made her intensely drowsy and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall The house was perfectly still She had never known it to be so silent before She heard neither voices nor footsteps and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead There would be a new Ayah and perhaps she would know some new stories Mary had been rather tired of the old ones She did not cry because her nurse had died She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves But if everyone had got well again surely some one would remember and come to look for her But no one came and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels She was not frightened because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room He slipped under the door as she watched him How queer and quiet it is she said It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound and then on the veranda They were mens footsteps and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms What desolation she heard one voice say That pretty pretty woman I suppose the child too I heard there was a child though no one ever saw her Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later She looked an ugly cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father He looked tired and troubled but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back Barney he cried out There is a child here A child alone In a place like this Mercy on us who is she I am Mary Lennox the little girl said drawing herself up stiffly She thought the man was very rude to call her fathers bungalow A place like this I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up Why does nobody come It is the child no one ever saw exclaimed the man turning to his companions She has actually been forgotten Why was I forgotten Mary said stamping her foot Why does nobody come The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away Poor little kid he said There is nobody left to come It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left that they had died and been carried away in the night and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib That was why the place was so quiet It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake";
   var secretGarden2 = "She slept a long time and when she awakened Mrs Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage and Mrs Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows It was quite dark when she awakened again The train had stopped at a station and Mrs Medlock was shaking her You have had a sleep she said It's time to open your eyes We're at Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs Medlock collected her parcels The little girl did not offer to help her because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train The station-master spoke to Mrs Medlock in a rough good-natured way pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire I see tha's got back he said An' tha's browt th' young 'un with thee Aye that's her answered Mrs Medlock speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary How's thy Missus Well enow Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was the burly station-master included When he shut the door mounted the box with the coachman and they drove off the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner but she was not inclined to go to sleep again She sat and looked out of the window curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs Medlock had spoken of She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up–a house standing on the edge of a moor What is a moor she said suddenly to Mrs Medlock Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see the woman answered We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor You won't see much because it's a dark night but you can see something Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner keeping her eyes on the window The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set our for sale Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees After that there seemed nothing different for a long time–or at least it seemed a long time to her At last the horses began to go more slowly as if they were climbing up-hill and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees She could see nothing in fact but a dense darkness on either side She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt Eh We're on the moor now sure enough said Mrs Medlock The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them A wind was rising and making a singular wild low rushing sound It's–it's not the sea is it said Mary looking round at her companion No not it answered Mrs Medlock Nor it isn't fields nor mountains it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep I feel as if it might be the sea if there were water on it said Mary It sounds like the sea just now That's the wind blowing through the bushes Mrs Medlock said It's a wild dreary enough place to my mind though there's plenty that likes it–particularly when the heather's in bloom On and on they drove through the darkness and though the rain stopped the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds The road went up and down and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land I don't like it she said to herself I don't like it and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light Mrs Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief Eh I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling she exclaimed It's the light in the lodge window We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit at all events It was after a bit as she said for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow The entrance door was a huge one made of massive curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars It opened into an enormous hall which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small odd little black figure and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked A neat thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them You are to take her to her room he said in a husky voice He doesn't want to see her He's going to London in the morning Very well Mr Pitcher Mrs Medlock answered So long as I know what's expected of me I can manage What's expected of you Mrs Medlock Mr Pitcher said is that you make sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table Mrs Medlock said unceremoniously: Well here you are This room and the next are where you'll live–and you must keep to them Don't you forget that It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life";
   var pridePrejudice28 = "Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford every eye was in search of the Parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants At length the Parsonage was discernible The garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving Mr Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party In a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other Mrs Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family They were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him But though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion When Mr Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte Once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London Mr Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation which he attended himself To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible Here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind He could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many tress there were in the most distant clump But of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house It was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground From his garden Mr Collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while Sir William accompanied him Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help It was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit When Mr Collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country It was spoken of again while they were at dinner when Mr Collins joining in observed: Yes Miss Elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church and I need not say you will be delighted with her She is all affability and condescension and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming We dine at Rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us I should say one of her ladyship's carriages for she has several Lady Catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added Charlotte and a most attentive neighbour Very true my dear that is exactly what I say She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of Mr Collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings A lively imagination soon settled it all About the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out– Oh my dear Eliza pray make haste and come into the dining-room for there is such a sight to be seen I will not tell you what it is Make haste and come down this moment Elizabeth asked questions in vain Maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate And is this all cried Elizabeth I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter La my dear said Maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not Lady Catherine The old lady is Mrs Jenkinson who lives with them the other is Miss de Bourgh Only look at her She is quite a little creature Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind Why does she not come in Oh Charlotte says she hardly ever does It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in I like her appearance said Elizabeth struck with other ideas She looks sickly and cross Yes she will do for him very well She will make him a very proper wife Mr Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and Sir William to Elizabeth's high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that wayAt length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house Mr Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day";
   var goldCoast1 = "The glory of an explorer I need hardly say results not so much from the extent or the marvels of his explorations as from the consequences to which they lead Judged by this test my little list of discoveries has not been unfavoured of fortune Where two purblind fever-stricken men plodded painfully through fetid swamp and fiery thorn-bush over the Zanzibar-Tanganyika track mission-houses and schools may now be numbered by the dozen Missionaries bring consuls and consuls bring commerce and colonisation On the Gold Coast of Western Africa whence came the good old guinea not a washing-cradle not a pound of quicksilver was to be found in 1862 in 1882 five mining companies are at work and in 1892 there will be as many score I had long and curiously watched from afar the movement of the Golden Land our long-neglected El Dorado before the opportunity of a revisit presented itself At last in the autumn of 1881 Mr James Irvine of Liverpool formerly of the West African Oil-rivers and now a large mine-owner in the Gulf of Guinea proposed to me a tour with the object of inspecting his concessions and I proposed to myself a journey of exploration inland The Foreign Office liberally gave me leave to escape the winter of Trieste where the ferocious Bora (nor-nor-easter) wages eternal war with the depressing and distressing Scirocco or south-easter Some One marvelled aloud and said You are certainly the first that ever applied to seek health in the “genial and congenial climate” of the West African Coast But then Some One had not realised the horrors of January and February at the storm-beaten head of the ever unquiet Adriatic Thus it happened that on November 181881 after many adieux and au revoirs I found myself on board the Cunard ss Demerara

inhaled a quant suff of choking vapour even in the comfortable Britannia Hotel and on the morning of the 23rd we awoke to find ourselves moored alongside of the new warehouses on the new port of Hungarian or rather Croatian Fiume Fiume had made prodigious strides since I last saw her in 1878 and she is gradually taking the wind out of the sails of her sister-rival While old Tergeste wastes time and trouble upon futile questions of policy and angry contrasts between Germans and Slavs and Italians and Triestines Fiume looks to the main chance The neat clean and well-watered little harbour-city may be called a two-dinner-a-day place so profuse is her hospitality to strangers Here too we once more enjoyed her glorious outlook the warm winter sun gilding the snowy-silvery head of Monte Maggiore and raining light and life upon the indigo-tinted waters of Fiume Bay Next to Naples I know nothing in Europe more beautiful than this ill-named Quarnero We saw a shot or so of the far-famed Whitehead torpedo which now makes twenty-one miles an hour and on Nov 25 we began to run down the Gulf en route for Patras It was a pleasure to emerge from the stern and gloomy Adriatic and nothing could be more lovely than the first evening amongst the Ionian Islands To port backed by the bold heights of the Grecian sea-range lay the hoary mount and the red cliffs 780 feet high of Sapphos Leap a never-forgotten memory Starboard rose bleak Ithaca fronting the black mountain of Cephalonia now bald and bare but clothed with dark forests till these were burnt down by some mischievous malignant Whatever of sterility deformed the scene lay robed under a glory of colour painted with perfect beauty by the last smile of the sun Earth and air and sea showed every variety of the chromatic scale especially of rose-tints from the tenderest morning blush of virgin snow to the vinous evening flush upon the lowlands washed by the purple wave The pure translucent vault never ceased to shift its chameleon-like hues that ranged between the diaphanous azure of the zenith and the faintest rainbow green a border-land where blue and yellow met and parted The air felt soft and balmy a holy calm was on the face of creation all looked delicious after the rude north and we acknowledged once more that life was worth living Patras also has greatly improved since I last saw her in 1872 The malaria-swamps to the north and south of the town have been drained and are being warped up: the never-failing succession of aguish fevers will presently fade out of the guide-books A macadamised boulevard has been built and a breakwater is building The once desert square Georgios A has been planted with trees which should be Eucalyptus and adorned with two French statues of bronze which harmonise admirably with the surroundings The thoroughfares are still Sloughs of Despond after rain and gridirons of St Laurence in dusty summer but there are incipient symptoms of trottoirs And throughout there is a disappearance of the hovels which resembled Port Said in her younger day and a notable substitution of tall solid houses All this has been brought about by fruit which in Patras means currants that is Corinthian grapes The export this year is unusual 110000 tons including the Morea and the Islands and of this total only 20000 go to France for wine-making It gives a surprising idea of the Christmas plum-pudding manufacture Patras also imports for all the small adjacent places inhabited by shaggy capotes And she will have a fine time when that talented and energetic soldier General Türr whom we last met at Venice begins the piercing of the Isthmus À propos of which one might suggest to Patras with due respect that (politically speaking) honesty is the best policy Being at Patras on St Andrews Day with a Scotch demoiselle on board we could hardly but pilgrimage to the place of the Apostles martyrdom Mrs Wood kindly sent her daughters to do the honours Aghyos Andreas lies at the extreme south of the town on the system of ruts called a road which conducts down-coast The church is a long yellow barn fronting a cypress-grown cemetery whose contents are being transferred to the new extramural A little finger of the holy man reposes under a dwarf canopy in the south-eastern angle: his left arm is preserved at Mount Athos in a silver reliquary set with gems Outside near the south-western corner is the old well of Demeter (Ceres) which has not lost its curative virtues by being baptised You descend a dwarf flight of brick steps to a mean shrine and portrait of the saint and remark the solid bases and the rude rubble arch of the pagan temple A fig-tree under which the martyrdom took place grew in the adjacent court it has long been cut down probably for fuel The population of Patras still affords a fine study of the dirty picturesque with clothes mostly home-made sheepskin cloaks fustanellas or kilts which contain a whole piece of calico red leggings and the rudest of sandals Turkish caps and an occasional pistol-belt The Palikar still struts about in all his old bravery and the bourgeois humbly imitates the dingy garb of Southern Italy The people have no taste for music no regard for art no respect for antiquities except for just as much as these will bring They own two and only two objects in life: firstly to make money and secondly to keep and not to spend it But this dark picture has a bright side No race that I know is so greedy of education the small boys instead of wending unwillingly to school crowd the doors before they are opened Where this exceptional feeling is universal we may hope for much The last evening at Patras showed us a beautiful view of what is here called Parnassus (Parnassó) the tall bluff mountain up the Gulf whose snows at sunset glowed like a balass ruby We left the Morea at 2 AM (December 2) and covered the fifty-two miles to Zante before breakfast There is and ever has been

It is being prolonged southwards to the old quarantine-ground and the modern prison which rests upon the skirts of the remarkable Skopo the Prospect Mountain 1489 feet high This feature which first shows itself to mariners approaching Zakynthos from north or from south has a saddle-back sky-line with a knob of limestone shaped like a Turkish pommel and sheltering its monastery Panaghia of Skopo alias Our Lady of the Look-out Below it appears another and a similar outcrop near a white patch which has suggested marble-quarrying and the northern flank is dotted with farmhouses and villas The dwarf breakwater so easily prolonged over the shallows has not been improved but at its base rises a brand-new opera-house big enough for a first-rate city Similarly at Barletta they raised a loan to build a mole and they built a theatre Unlike Patras Zante long had the advantage of Italian and then of English rule and the citizens care for music more than for transformation-scenes The Palikar element also is notably absent and the soldiers are in uniform not in half-uniform and half-brigand attire I missed the British flag once so conspicuous upon the southern round tower of the castle where in days or rather nights of old I had spent not a few jolly hours but I heard with pleasure that it is proposed to make a haute-ville of the now deserted and crumbling triangle a Sommerfrisch where the parboiled citizens of Athens will find a splendid prospect and a cooling sea-breeze Mr E Barff kindly accompanied us in the usual drive round the Wrekin for which we may here read the wreck We set out along the sea-flank of the Castle hill This formation once a regular hogs-back has been split by weather about the middle and its southern end has been shaken down by earthquakes and carved by wind and rain into precipices and pinnacles of crumbling sandstone which form the Grey Cliffs Having heard at Patras the worst accounts of Zante since it passed under Greek rule I was not a little surprised by the excellent condition of the roads and the general look of prosperity Turning to the right we entered Mr Barffs garden-house where the grounds were bright and beautiful with balsam and mignonette dahlias and cyclamens chrysanthemums and oleanders jasmine and double-violets orange-blossoms and a perfect Gulistan of roses roses of York and Lancaster white pink and purple yellow and green–a perfumed spring in dreary December Laden with bouquets we again threaded the olive-grounds whose huge trunks are truly patriarchal and saw basking in the sun old Eumæus the Swine-King waiting upon his black and bristly herd The glimpse led to a characteristic tale A wealthy Greek merchant in London had made the most liberal offers to his brother a shepherd in the hills of Cephalonia the latter returned his very best thanks but declared himself perfectly happy and unwilling to tempt fortune by change of condition to England Greece it is evident has not ceased to breed wise men We returned viâ the landward flank of the hogs-back along the fine plain (O Kampos) bounded west by the range called after Mount Meriy the apex rising 3274 feet Anglo-Zantiots fondly compare its outline with the Juras The look of the rich lowlands the vale as our charts call it suggested a river-valley but river there is none Every nook and corner was under cultivation and each country-house had its chapel and its drying-ground for fruit level yards now hidden under large-leaved daisies and wild flowers We passed through the Graetani village whose tenants bear a bad name and saw none of the pretty faces for which Zante is famed The sex was dressed in dark jackets and petticoats à litalienne and the elders were apparently employed in gathering bitter herbs dandelion and the wild endive Verily this is a frugal race The drive ended with passing up the Strada Larga the inner High Street running parallel with the Marina After Turkish fashion trades flock together shoemakers to the south and vegetable-vendors to the north There are two good specimens of Venetian palazzetti one fantastic the other classical and there is a rough pavement which is still wanting in Patras A visit to the silk-shop of Garafuglia Papaiouanou was obligatory: here the golden-hued threads reminded me of the Indian Tussur-moth Also de rigueur was the purchase of nougat and raki the local mandorlato and mastaché almond-cake and grape-spirit Zante appears to me an excellent home for a large family with a small income A single man lives at the best hotel (Nazionale) for forty-five francs per week A country-house with nine bedrooms cellarage stabling dog-house orangery and large garden is to be had for 25l a year Fowls cost less than a franc turkeys if you do not buy them from a shipchandler two francs and a half The strong and sherry-flavoured white wine of Zante rarely exceeds three shillings the gallon sixpence a bottle And other necessaries in the same proportion But oh that St Dionysius patron saint of Zante would teach his protégés a little of that old Persian wisdom which abhorred a lie and its concomitants cheating and mean trickery The Esmeralda after two days and one night at Zante was charged 15l for pilotage when the captain piloted himself for church where there is no parson and for harbour dues where there is no harbour It is almost incredible that so sharp-witted a race can also be so short-sighted so wise about pennies so foolish about pounds On Saturday we left Zante in the teeth of a fresh but purely local north-easter which whistled through the gear and hurled the spray high up Cape Skinari The result was as the poet sings– That peculiar up-and-down motion Which belongs to the treacherous ocean Not without regret I saw the last of the memorious old castle and of Skopo the picturesque We ran along the western shore of Cephalonia the isle of three hundred villages: anyone passing this coast at once understands how Greece produced so many and such excellent seamen The island was a charming spectacle with its two culminations Maraviglia (3311 ft) and Elato (5246 ft) both capped by purple cloud its fertile slopes and its fissured bight Argostoli Bay running deep into the land We fondly expected to pass the Messina Straits by daylight and to cast another glance upon old Etna Scylla and Charybdis the Liparis and Stromboli And all looked well as about noon we were abreast of Cape Spartivento the Split-wind which divides the mild northers and southers of the Straits from the raw Boras and rotting Sciroccos of the Adriatic But presently a signal for succour was hoisted by a marvellous old tub a sailer-made-steamer sans boats sans gunwales a something whose dirt and general dilapidation suggested the Flying Dutchman I almost expected to see her drop out of form and crumble into dust as our boys boarded her The America of Barletta bound from Brindisi to Genoa had hurt her boilers We hauled in her cable–these gentry must never be trusted with a chance of slipping loose–and tugged her into Messina thereby losing a valuable day The famous Straits were almost a replica of Ionian Island scenery: the shores of the Mediterranean limestone and sandstone with here and there a volcanic patch continually repeat themselves After passing the barren heel of the Boot and its stony big toe the wady-streaked shores become populous and well cultivated while railway trains on either side island and continent toss their snowy plumes in the pride of civilisation The ruined castles on the crags and the new villages on the lowlands told their own story of Turkish and Algerine piracy now doomed to the limbo of things that were In the evening we were safely anchored within the zancle (sickle) of Messina-port whose depth of water and circular shape have suggested an old crater flooded It was Sunday and we were greeted with the familiar sounds the ringing of cracked bells the screaming of harsh hoarse voices a military band and detached musical performances The classical facade of the Marina through whose nineteen archways and upper parallelograms you catch a vista of dark narrow wynd contrasts curiously with Catania: the former is a dicky a front hiding something unclean while the latter is laid out in Eastern style where for the best of reasons the marble palace hides behind a wall of mud The only new features I noted were a metal fish-market engineer art which contrasts marvellously with the Ionic pilasters and the solid ashlar of the dicky and at the root of the sickle a new custom-house of six detached boxes reddest-roofed and whitest-walled built to copy childrens toy cottages Croatian Fiume would blush to own them Of the general impurity of the town and of the bouquet de Messine the less said the better As we made fast to the Marina our tobacco was temporarily sealed after the usual mean Italian fashion Next morning an absurd old person in a broad red baldrick came on board and counted noses to ascertain that we had not brought the dreaded small-pox from the Ionian Islands After being graciously and liberally allowed to land we were visited by the local chapmen whose goods appeared rather mixed–polished cowhorns and mildewed figs dolls in costume and corrosive oranges by the normal musical barber who imitates at a humble distance bird and beast and by the vendor of binoculars who asks forty francs and who takes ten The captain noted his protest at the Consulate and claimed by way of sauvetage 200l The owners offered 200 lire–punds Scots Briefly noon had struck before we passed out of the noise and the smells of Messina Our good deed had cost us dear A wet scirocco had replaced the bright norther and saddened all the view Passing the tide-rip Charybdis a meeting of currents which called only for another hand at the wheel and the castled crag of naughty Scylla whose town has grown prodigiously we bade adieu to the tower of Pelorus Then we shaped our course for the Islands of Æolus or the Winds and the Lipari archipelago all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as Ossians spectres And we plodded through the dreary dull-grey scene of drizzling scirocco– Till when all veilèd sank in darkling air Naught but the welkin and the wave was there Next morning showed us to port the Cone of Maritimo: it outlies Marsala whose wine caused the blinding of Polyphemus and since that time has brought on many an attack of liver The world then became to us pontus et aer Days and nights were equally uneventful the diary tells only of quiet seas under the lee of Sardinia and of the Balearics ghostly glimpses of the North African coast and the steady setting in of the normal wester the indraught of the Straits On Friday (November 9) the weather broke and deluged us with rain At Gibraltar the downpour lasted twenty-four hours We found ourselves at anchor before midnight with a very low barometer which suggested unpleasantries Next morning we sighted the deep blue waters of the Bay and the shallow brown waters of the Bayside crested with foam by a furious norther that had powdered the far Ronda highlands with snow Before noon however the gale had abated and allowed me to transfer myself and African outfit on board the Fez (Capt Hay) Moroccan Steamship Company trading to North Africa This was a godsend: there is no regular line between Gibraltar and Lisbon and one might easily be delayed for a week The few hours halt allowed me time to call upon my old friend M Dautez a Belgian artist Apparently he is the only person in the place who cares for science He has made extensive collections He owns twenty-four coins from Carteia whereas Florez (Medallas Madrid 1773) shows a total of only thirty-three Amongst his antiquities there is a charming statuette of Minerva a bronze miniature admirably finished He has collected the rock fauna especially the molluscs fossil and modern He is preparing an album of the Flora Calpensis His birds nests were lately sold to an Englishman All these objects of immense local interest were offered by him at the lowest possible rate to the Military Library but who is there to understand their value I wonder how many Englishmen on the Rock know that they are within easy ride of the harbour which named the Ships of Tarshish Tartessus which was Carteia although certain German geographers would against the general voice of antiquity make the former the country and the latter the city lay on both sides of the little Guadarranque stream generally called First River and the row of tumuli on the left bank probably denotes the site of the famous docks I was anxious to open diggings in 1872 but permission was not forthcoming: now however they say that the Duke of Medina Sidonia would offer no objections Gib though barbarous in matters of science is civilised as regards business It was a treat to see steamer after steamer puff in load up with blue peter at the fore and start off after a few hours which would have been days at Patras Zante and Messina Here men work with a will as a walk from the Convent to the Old Mole the Mersa or water-port of a Moroccan town amply proves The uniforms are neat and natty–they were the reverse five years ago–and it is a pleasure to look upon the fresh faces of English girls still unstained by unconsumed carbon And the authorities have had the good sense to preserve the old Moorish town of Tárik and his successors the triangle of walls with the tall tower-like mosque for apex and the base facing the bay We left Gibraltar at 5 PM on Saturday (December 10) giving a wide berth to the hated Pearl Rock which skippers would remove by force of arms Seen from east or west Gib has an outline of its own The Britisher whose pride it is sees the lion of England who has laid his paw upon the key of the Mediterranean and compares it with the king of beasts sejant the tail being Europa Point The Spaniards to whom it is an eyesore liken it to a shrouded corpse the outlined head lying to the north and declare truly enough that to them it is a dead body The norther presently changed to the rainy south-wester the builder of the Moroccan bars and the scourge of the coast fringing North-west Africa Rolling set in with the usual liveliness Events were not eventful The first midnight found us off Cape Trafalgar and the second off St Vincent At 4 PM (December 12) we saw the light of Espíchel (Promóntorium Barbaricum) the last that shines upon the voyager bound Brazilwards Before nightfall we had left Buzio lighthouse to starboard We then ran up the northern passage in charge of a lagging pilot and as the lamps were lighting we found ourselves comfortably berthed off that pretty toy Belem Tower Next morning broke upon a lovely view: no wonder that the Tagus is the pride of Portuguese bards The Rosicler or rosy dawn-light was that of a May morning–the May of poetry not of meteorology–and the upper windows of distant Lisbon were all ablaze with the unrisen sun It was a picture for the loveliest colours not for word-painting and the whole scene was classical as picturesque We may justly say of it Nullum sine nomine saxum Far over the rising hills of the north bank rose shaggy Cintra the most blessed spot in the habitable globe with its memorious convent and its Moorish castle The nearer heights were studded with the oldest-fashioned windmills when the newest are found even in the Canaries a single crest bore its bakers dozen mostly decapitated by steam Advancing we remarked the glorious Belem monastery defiled by its ignoble modern ruin to the west the new hippodrome crowning the grassy slope the Bed House of Belem now being brightened up for Royal residence during the Exhibition of 1882 the Memoria and the Ajuda Palace more unfinished if possible than ever As we approached the bulk of the city the marking objects were the cypressed Prazeres Cemetery the red Necessidades Palace and the Estrella whose dome and domelets built to mimic St Peters look only like hen and chickens Then in due time came the Carmo Church still unrepaired since 1755 Blackhorse Square still bare of trees the Government offices still propped to prevent a tumble-down and the old Custom House still a bilious yellow the vast barrack-like pile of S Vicente the historic Sé or cathedral with dumpy towers the black Castle of São Jorge so hardly wrung from the gallant Moors and the huge Santa Engracia apparently ever to be a ruin I spent a pleasant week at Lisbon and had a fair opportunity of measuring what progress she has made during the last sixteen years We have no longer to wander up and down disconsolate Mid many things unsightly to strange ee If the beggars remain the excessive dirt and the vagrant dogs have disappeared The Tagus has a fine embankment but the land side is occupied by mean warehouses The sewers like those of Trieste still want a cloaca maxama a general conduit of masonry running along the quay down-stream The Rocio has been planted with mean trees greatly to the disgust of the average Lusitanian who hates such sun-excluding vegetation like a backwoodsman yet the Quintella squarelet shows what fine use may be made of cactus and pandanus aloes and palms not to mention the ugly and useful eucalyptus The thoroughfares are far cleaner than they were and Lisbon is now surrounded by good roads The new houses are built with some respect for architectonic effect of light and shade: such fine old streets as the Rua Augusta offend the eye by façades flat as cards with rows of pips for windows Finally a new park is being laid out to the north of the Passeio Publico Having always found Olisipo exceptionally hospitable and pleasant I look forward to the days when she will be connected with Paris by direct railway Her hotels are first-rate her prices are not excessive her winter climate is delightful and she is the centre of most charming excursions The capital has thrown off much of her old lethargy Her Geographical Society is doing hard and honest work she has nobly expiated the national crime by becoming a Camonian city and she indulges freely in exhibitions One of Ornamental Art was about to be opened when I last saw her and it extended deep into the next spring";
   var whatISawInCali1 = "For the general information of the reader it will be proper to give a brief geographical sketch of California and some account of its political and social institutions as they have heretofore existed The district of country known geographically as Upper California is bounded on the north by Oregon the fortysecond degree of north latitude being the boundary line between the two territories on the east by the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra de los Mimbres a continuation of the same range on the south by Sonora and Old or Lower California and on the west by the Pacific Ocean Its extent from north to south is about 700 miles and from east to west from 600 to 800 miles with an area of about 400000 square miles A small portion only of this extensive territory is fertile or inhabitable by civilized man and this portion consists chiefly in the strip of country along the Pacific Ocean about 700 miles in length and from 100 to 150 in breadth bounded on the east by the Sierra Nevada and on the west by the Pacific In speaking of Upper California this strip of country is what is generally referred to The largest river of Upper California is the Colorado or Red which has a course of about 1000 miles and empties into the Gulf of California in latitude about 32 degrees north But little is known of the region through which this stream flows The report of trappers however is that the river is canoned between high mountains and precipices a large portion of its course and that its banks and the country generally through which it flows are arid sandy and barren Green and Grand Rivers are its principal upper tributaries both of which rise in the Rocky Mountains and within the territories of the United States The Gila is its lowest and largest branch emptying into the Colorado just above its mouth Sevier and Virgin Rivers are also tributaries of the Colorado Mary’s River rises near latitude 42 degrees north and has a course of about 400 miles when its waters sink in the sands of the desert This river is not laid down on any map which I have seen The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers have each a course of from 300 to 400 miles the first flowing from the north and the last from the south and both emptying into the Bay of St Francisco at the same point They water the large and fertile valley lying between the Sierra Nevada and the coast range of mountains I subjoin a description of the valley and river San Joaquin from the pen of a gentleman (Dr Marsh) who has explored the river from its source to its mouth This noble valley is the first undoubtedly in California and one of the most magnificent in the world It is about 500 miles long with anaverage width of about fifty miles It is bounded on the east by the great Snowy Mountains and on the west by the low range which in many places dwindles into insignificant hills and has its northern terminus at the Strait of Carquines on the Bay of San Francisco and its southern near the Colorado River The river of San Joaquin flows through the middle of the valley for about half of its extent and thence diverges towards the eastern mountain in which it has its source About sixty miles further south is the northern end of the Buena Vista Lake which is about one hundred miles long and from ten to twenty wide Still farther south and near the western side of the valley is another and much smaller lake The great lake receives about a dozen tributaries on its eastern side which all rise in the great range of the Snowy Mountains Some of these streams flow through broad and fertile valleys within the mountain’s range and from thence emerging irrigate the plains of the great valley for the distance of twenty or thirty miles The largest of these rivers is called by the Spanish inhabitants the river Reyes and falls into the lake near its northern end it is a welltimbered stream and flows through a country of great fertility and beauty The tributaries of the San Joaquin are all on the east side On ascending the stream we first meet with the Stanislaus a clear rapid mountain stream some forty or fifty yards wide with a considerable depth of water in its lower portion The Mormons have commenced a settlement called New Hope and built some two or three houses near the mouth There are considerable bodies of fertile land along the river and the higher plains afford good pasturage Ten miles higher up is the river of the Tawalomes it is about the size of the Stanislaus which it greatly resembles except that the soil is somewhat better and that it particularly abounds with salmon Some thirty miles farther comes in the Merced much the largest of the tributaries of the San Joaquin The lands along and between the tributaries of the San Joaquin and the lake of Buena Vista form a fine pastoral region with a good proportion of arable land and a very inviting field for emigration The whole of this region has been but imperfectly explored enough however is known to make it certain that it is one of the most desirable regions on the continent In the valleys of the rivers which come down from the great Snowy Mountains are vast bodies of pine and redwood or cedar timber and the streams afford water power to any desirable amount The whole country east of the San Joaquin and the water communication which connects it with the lakes is considered by the best judges to be particularly adapted to the culture of the vine which must necessarily become one of the principal agricultural resources of California” The Salinas River empties into the Pacific about twelve miles above Monterey Bear River empties into the Great Salt Lake The other streams of California are all small In addition to the Great Salt Lake and the Utah Lake there are numerous small lakes in the Sierra Nevada The San Joaquin is connected with Tule Lake or Lake Buena Vista a sheet of water about eighty miles in length and fifteen in breadth A lake not laid down in any map and known as the Laguna among the Californians is situated about sixty miles north of the Bay of San Francisco It is between forty and sixty miles in length The valleys in its vicinity are highly fertile and romantically beautiful In the vicinity of this lake there is a mountain of pure sulphur There are also soda springs and a great variety of other mineral waters and minerals The principal mountains west of the eastern boundary of California (the Rocky Mountains) are the Bear River Wahsatch Utah the Sierra Nevada and the Coast range The Wahsatch Mountains form the eastern rim of the great interior basin” There are numerous ranges in this desert basin all of which run north and south and are separated from each other by spacious and barren valleys and plains The Sierra Nevada range is of greater elevation than the Rocky Mountains The summits of the most elevated peaks are covered with perpetual snow This and the coast range run nearly parallel with the shore of the Pacific The first is from 100 to 200 miles from the Pacific and the last from forty to sixty miles The valley between them is the most fertile portion of California Upper California was discovered in 1548 by Cabrillo a Spanish navigator In 1578 the northern portion of it was visited by Sir Francis Drake who called it New Albion It was first colonized by the Spaniards in 1768 and formed a province of Mexico until after the revolution in that country There have been numerous revolutions and civil wars in California within the last twenty years but up to the conquest of the country by the United States in 1846 Mexican authority has generally been exercised over it The following description of the political and social condition of Upper California in 1822 is extracted and translated from a Spanish writer of that date I have thought that the extract would not be uninteresting:- Government-Upper California on account of its small population not being able to become a state of the great Mexican republic takes the character of territory the government of which is under the charge of a commandantgeneral who exercises the charge of a superior political chief whose attributes depend entirely upon the president of the republic and the general congress But to amplify the legislation of its centre it has a deputation made up of seven vocals the half of these individuals being removed every two years The superior political chief presides at their sessions The inhabitants of the territory are divided amongst the presidios missions and towns Presidios-The necessity of protecting the apostolic predication was the obligatory reason for forming the presidios which were established according to circumstances That of San Diego was the first Santa Barbara Monterey and San Francisco were built afterwards The form of all of them is nearly the same and this is a square containing about two hundred yards in each front formed of a weak wall made of mudbricks Its height may be four yards in the interior of the square and built on to the same wall In its entire circumference are a chapel storehouses and houses for the commandant officers and troops having at the entrance of the presidio quarters for a corpsdegarde These buildings in the presidios at the first idea appear to have been sufficient the only object having been for a defence against a surprise from the gentiles or wild Indians in the immediate vicinity But this cause having ceased I believe they ought to be demolished as they are daily threatening a complete ruin and from the very limited spaces of habitation must be very incommodious to those who inhabit them As to the exterior of the presidios several private individuals have built some very decent houses and having evinced great emulation in this branch of business I have no doubt but in a short time we shall see very considerable towns in California At the distance of one or at the most two miles from the presidio and near to the anchoringground is a fort which has a few pieces of artillery of small calibre The situation of most of them is very advantageous for the defence of the port though the form of the walls esplanades and other imperfections which may be seen make them very insignificant The battalion of each presidio is made up of eighty or more horse soldiers called cuera besides these it has a number of auxiliary troops and a detachment of artillery The commandant of each presidio is the captain of its respective company and besides the intervention military and political he has charge of all things relating to the marine department Missions-The missions contained in the territory are twentyone They were built at different epochs: that of San Diego being the first was built in 1769 its distance from the presidio of the same name is two leagues The rest were built successively according to circumstances and necessity The last one was founded in the year 1822 under the name of San Francisco Dolores and is the most northern of all The edifices in some of those missions are more extensive than in others but in form they are all nearly equal They are all fabricated of mudbricks and the divisions are according to necessity In all of them may be found commodious habitations for the ministers storehouses to keep their goods in proportional granaries offices for soapmakers weavers blacksmiths and large parterres and horse and cattle pens independent apartments for Indian youths of each sex and all such offices as were necessary at the time of its institution Contiguous to and communicating with the former is a church forming a part of the edifices of each mission they are all very proportionable and are adorned with profusion The Indians reside about two hundred yards distant from the abovementioned edifice This place is called the rancheria Most of the missions are made up of very reduced quarters built with mudbricks forming streets while in others the Indians have been allowed to follow their primitive customs their dwellings being a sort of huts in a conical shape which at the most do not exceed four yards in diameter and the top of the cone may be elevated three yards They are built of rough sticks covered with bulrushes or grass in such a manner as to completely protect the inhabitants from all the inclemencies of the weather In my opinion these rancherias are the most adequate to the natural uncleanliness of the Indians as the families often renew them burning the old ones and immediately building others with the greatest facility Opposite the rancherias and near to the mission is to be found a small garrison with proportionate rooms for a corporal and five soldiers with their families This small garrison is quite sufficient to prevent any attempt of the Indians from taking effect there having been some examples made which causes the Indians to respect this small force One of these pickets in a mission has a double object besides keeping the Indians in subjection they run post with a monthly correspondence or with any extraordinaries that may be necessary for government All the missions in this California are under the charge of religious men of the order of San Francisco At the present time their number is twentyseven most of them of an advanced age Each mission has one of these fathers for its administrator and he holds absolute authority The tilling of the ground the gathering of the harvest the slaughtering of cattle the weaving and everything that concerns the mission is under the direction of the fathers without any other person interfering in any way whatever so that if any one mission has the good fortune to be superintended by an industrious and discreet padre the Indians disfrute in abundance all the real necessaries of life at the same time the nakedness and misery of any one mission are a palpable proof of the inactivity of its director The missions extend their possessions from one extremity of the territory to the other and have made the limits of one mission from those of another Though they do not require all this land for their agriculture and the maintenance of their stock they have appropriated the whole always strongly opposing any individual who may wish to settle himself or his family on any piece of land between them But it is to be hoped that the new system of illustration and the necessity of augmenting private properly and the people of reason will cause the government to take such adequate measures as will conciliate the interests of all Amongst all the missions there are from twentyone to twentytwo thousand Catholic Indians but each mission has not an equal or a proportionate part in its congregation Some have three or four thousand whilst others have scarcely four hundred and at this difference may be computed the riches of the missions in proportion Besides the number of Indians already spoken of each mission has a considerable number of gentiles who live chiefly on farms annexed to the missions The number of these is undetermined The Indians are naturally filthy and careless and their understanding is very limited In the small arts they are not deficient in ideas of imitation but they never will be inventors Their true character is that of being revengeful and timid consequently they are very much addicted to treachery They have no knowledge of benefits received and ingratitude is common amongst them The education they receive in their infancy is not the proper one to develope their reason and if it were I do not believe them capable of any good impression All these Indians whether from the continual use of the sweathouse or from their filthiness or the little ventilation in their habitations are weak and unvigorous spasms and rheumatics to which they are so much subject are the consequences of their customs But what most injures them and prevents propagation is the venereal disease which most of them have very strongly clearly proving that their humours are analogous to receiving the impressions of this contagion From this reason may be deduced the enormous differences between the births and deaths which without doubt is onetenth per year in favour of the latter but the missionaries do all in their power to prevent this with respect to the catechumens situated near them The general productions of the missions are the breed of the larger class of cattle and sheep horses wheat maize or Indian corn beans peas and other vegetables though the productions of the missions situated more to the southward are more extensive these producing the grape and olive in abundance Of all these articles of production the most lucrative is the large cattle their hides and tallow affording an active commerce with foreign vessels on this coast This being the only means the inhabitants missionaries or private individuals have of supplying their actual necessities for this reason they give this branch all the impulse they possibly can and on it generally place all their attention It is now six years since they began to gather in hides and tallow for commerce Formerly they merely took care of as many or as much as they required for their own private use and the rest was thrown away as useless but at this time the actual number of hides sold annually on board of foreign vessels amounts to thirty or forty thousand and about the same amount of arrobas (twentyfive pounds) of tallow and in pursuing their present method there is no doubt but in three or four years the amount of the exportation of each of these articles will be doubled Flax linen wine oliveoil grain and other agricultural productions would be very extensive if there were stimulants to excite industry but this not being the case there is just grain enough sown and reaped for the consumption of the inhabitants in the territory The towns contained in this district are three the most populous being that of Angeles which has about twelve hundred souls that of St Joseph’s of Guadaloupe may contain six hundred and the village of Branciforte two hundred they are all formed imperfectly and without order each person having built his own house on the spot he thought most convenient for himself The first of these pueblos is governed by its corresponding body of magistrates composed of an alcalde or judge four regidores or municipal officers a syndic and secretary the second of an alcalde two regidores a syndic and secretary and the third on account of the smallness of its population is subject to the commandancia of Monterey The inhabitants of the towns are white and to distinguish them from the Indians are vulgarly called people of reason The number of these contained in the territory may be nearly five thousand These families are divided amongst the pueblos and presidios They are nearly all the descendants of a small number of individuals who came from the Mexican country some as settlers others in the service of the army and accompanied by their wives In the limited space of little more than fifty years the present generation has been formed The whites are in general robust healthy and well made Some of them are occupied in breeding and raising cattle and cultivating small quantities of wheat and beans but for want of sufficient land for which they cannot obtain a rightful ownership their labours are very limited Others dedicate themselves to the service of arms All the presidial companies are composed of the natives of the country but the most of them are entirely indolent it being very rare for any individual to strive to augment his fortune Dancing horseriding and gambling occupy all their time The arts are entirely unknown and I am doubtful if there is one individual who exercises any trade very few who understand the first rudiments of letters and the other sciences are unknown amongst them The fecundity of the people of reason is extreme It is very rare to find a married couple with less than five or six children while there are hundreds who have from twelve to fifteen Very few of them die in their youth and in reaching the age of puberty are sure to see their grandchildren The age of eighty and one hundred has always been common in this climate most infirmities are unknown here and the freshness and robustness of the people show the beneficial influence of the climate the women in particular have always the roses stamped on their cheeks This beautiful species is without doubt the most active and laborious all their vigilance in duties of the house the cleanliness of their children and attention to their husbands dedicating all their leisure moments to some kind of occupation that may be useful towards their maintenance Their clothing is always clean and decent nakedness being entirely unknown in either sex Ports and Commerce-There are four ports principal bays in this territory which take the names of the corresponding presidios The best guarded is that of San Diego That of San Francisco has many advantages Santa Barbara is but middling in the best part of the season at other times always bad Besides the abovementioned places vessels sometimes anchor at Santa Cruz San Luis Obispo El Refugio San Pedro and San Juan that they may obtain the productions of the missions nearest these lastmentioned places but from an order sent by the minister of war and circulated by the commandantegeneral we are given to understand that no foreign vessel is permitted to anchor at any of these places Monterey only excepted notwithstanding the commandantegeneral has allowed the first three principal ports to remain open provisionally Were it not so there would undoubtedly be an end to all commerce with California as I will quickly show The only motive that induces foreign vessels to visit this coast is for the hides and tallow which they barter for in the territory It is well known that at any of these parts there is no possibility of realizing any money for here it does not circulate The goods imported by foreign vessels are intended to facilitate the purchase of the aforesaid articles well knowing that the missions have no interest in money but rather such goods as are necessary for the Indians so that several persons who have brought goods to sell for nothing but money have not been able to sell them It will appear very extraordinary that money should not be appreciated in a country where its value is so well known but the reason may be easily perceived by attending to the circumstances of the territory The quantity of hides gathered yearly is about thirty or forty thousand and the arrobas of tallow with very little difference will be about the same Averaging the price of each article at two dollars we shall see that the intrinsic value in annual circulation in California is 140000 dollars This sum divided between twentyone missions will give each one 6666 dollars Supposing the only production of the country converted into money with what would the Indians be clothed and by what means would they be able to cover a thousand other necessaries Money is useful in amplifying speculations but in California as yet there are no speculations and it productions are barely sufficient for the absolute necessary consumption The same comparison may be made with respect to private individuals who are able to gather a few hides and a few arrobas of tallow these being in small quantities";
   var aliceWonderLand4 = "It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur and whiskers She'll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets Where can I have dropped them I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone Why Mary Ann what are you doing out here Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake that it had made He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am But I'd better take him his fan and gloves—that is if I can find them As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: 'Miss Alice Come here directly and get ready for your walk' 'Coming in a minute nurse But I've got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back and see that the mouse doesn't get out' Only I don't think Alice went on that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips I know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever I eat or drink anything: so I'll just see what this bottle does I do hope it'll make me grow large again for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself That's quite enough—I hope I shan't grow any more—As it is I can't get out at the door—I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much Alas It was too late to wish that She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head Still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more whatever happens What will become of me Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it's rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairy tales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up I'll write one—but I'm grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone: at least there's no room to grow up any more here But then thought Alice shall I never get any older than I am now That'll be a comfort one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldn't like that Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself How can you learn lessons in here Why there's hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson books And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen Mary Ann Mary Ann said the voice Fetch me my gloves this moment Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inward and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure Alice heard it say to itself Then I'll go round and get in at the window That you won't thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air She did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of the sort Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit's— Pat Pat Where are you And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then I'm here Digging for apples yer honor Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily Here Come and help me out of this (Sounds of more broken glass) Now tell me Pat what's that in the window Sure it's an arm yer honor (He pronounced it arrum) An arm you goose Who ever saw one that size Why it fills the whole window Sure it does yer honor: but it's an arm for all that Well it's got no business there at any rate: go and take it away There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as Sure I don't like it yer honor at all at all Do as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass What a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought Alice I wonder what they'll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they could I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: Wheres the other ladder—Why I hadn't to bring but one Bill's got the other—Bill Fetch it here lad—Here put 'em up at this corner—No tie 'em together first—they don't reach half high enough yet—Oh they'll do well enough Don't be particular—Here Bill Catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear—Mind that loose slate—Oh it's coming down Heads below (a loud crash)— Now who did that—It was Bill I fancy—Who's to go down the chimney—Nay I shan't You do it—That I won't then—Bill's got to go down—Here Bill The master says you've got to go down the chimney Oh So Bill's got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to herself Why they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I think I can kick a little She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill  then the Rabbit's voice alone— Catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices— Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don't choke him—How was it old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about it Last came a little feeble squeaking voice ( That's Bill thought Alice) Well I hardly know—No more thank ye I'm better now—but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket So you did old fellow said the others We must burn the house down said the Rabbit's voice And Alice called out as loud as she could If you do I'll set Dinah at you There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what they will do next If they had any sense they'd take the roof off After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with A barrowful of what thought Alice But she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face I'll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out You'd better not do that again which produced another dead silence Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes she thought it's sure to make some change in my size and as it can't possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I suppose So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly As soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea-pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood The first thing I've got to do said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden I think that will be the best plan It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged: the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it: then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it: then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again: then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forward each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape: so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leaned against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much if—if I'd only been the right size to do it Oh dear I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again Let me see—how is it to be managed I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is 'What' The great question certainly was What Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with his arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else";
