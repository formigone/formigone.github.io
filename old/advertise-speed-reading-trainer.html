  <h1>Welcome to Speed Reader Trainer!</h1>
  <p>This application is designed to turn you into a speed reader. The way it works is very simple: slow readers have a few bad habits, and speed readers are aware of such poor reading habits, and by not doing such things, they are able to read 2, 5, or even 10 times as fast as the average adult.</p>
  <p>The key to reading super fast is to train your eyes to move across each line of text at a constant speed. Don't try to sound the words out in your head as you do so - with practice (repetition) your brain will be able to synthesize the meaning of each phrase.</p>
  <h2>How it works:</h2>
  <p>Once you start your training session, simply look at each word as they appear. Adjust the font size and text width until you are comfortable with the layout. Next, picture each word as they show up, and then picture the next with your eyes as soon as it appears. Do not worry about understanding. This will come with time.</p>
  <h2>Remember:</h2>
  <p>The key to becoming a speed reader is to practice good habits, and practice them often.</p>
